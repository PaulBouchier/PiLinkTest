This directory contains the last working version of a test program (python/linux side + Arduino side)
that loops back messages from python to Arduino to python using SerialTransfer.
Arduino callbacks are invoked that loop the data back to
python, where callbacks are invoked that receive the loopback data.
Sent and received data are compared.
